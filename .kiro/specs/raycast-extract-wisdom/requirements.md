# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a Raycast command called "extract wisdom" that integrates with the Fabric AI framework by Daniel Miessler. The command will allow users to quickly extract key insights, wisdom, and actionable takeaways from various types of content (text, articles, documents) directly from their Raycast interface. The Fabric AI framework provides AI-powered content analysis patterns, and the "extract wisdom" pattern specifically focuses on distilling the most valuable insights from any given content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Raycast user, I want to run an "extract wisdom" command on selected text or clipboard content, so that I can quickly get the most important insights without leaving my current workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user invokes the "extract wisdom" command THEN the system SHALL present options to analyze either selected text or clipboard content
2. WHEN the user selects a content source THEN the system SHALL send the content to the Fabric AI extract wisdom pattern
3. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL display the extracted wisdom in a readable format within Raycast
4. WHEN the user wants to copy the results THEN the system SHALL provide a copy action to save the wisdom to clipboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extracted wisdom to be properly formatted and structured, so that I can easily understand and act on the insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN wisdom is extracted THEN the system SHALL format the output with clear sections for main insights, key takeaways, and actionable items
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL use proper markdown formatting for readability
3. WHEN the content is too long THEN the system SHALL handle truncation gracefully and inform the user
4. IF the analysis fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with suggested next steps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure the Fabric AI connection settings, so that I can use my own API credentials and customize the analysis behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first runs the command THEN the system SHALL prompt for necessary configuration if not already set
2. WHEN configuring the connection THEN the system SHALL allow setting API endpoint, authentication credentials, and model preferences
3. WHEN configuration is saved THEN the system SHALL store settings securely using Raycast's preferences system
4. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and prevent command execution

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the command to handle different types of input content efficiently, so that I can extract wisdom from various sources like web articles, documents, or conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing different content types THEN the system SHALL handle plain text, markdown, and basic HTML content
2. WHEN content exceeds reasonable limits THEN the system SHALL truncate or chunk the content appropriately
3. WHEN processing large content THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator with progress feedback
4. IF content is empty or invalid THEN the system SHALL provide helpful guidance on proper usage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access my recent wisdom extractions, so that I can reference previous insights without re-running the analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the command is invoked THEN the system SHALL provide an option to view recent extractions
2. WHEN viewing history THEN the system SHALL display the last 10 extractions with timestamps and preview text
3. WHEN selecting a historical item THEN the system SHALL display the full wisdom extraction
4. WHEN managing history THEN the system SHALL provide options to clear or export previous results
