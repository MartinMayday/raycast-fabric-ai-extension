# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Notion database integration to the Raycast Fabric AI extension, allowing users to send their extracted wisdom results directly to a Notion database. This builds upon the existing export functionality (currently supporting spreadsheet export) by adding a "Send to Notion" action that maps the 20-column CSV structure to Notion database properties.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a knowledge worker using the Fabric AI extension, I want to send my extraction results to my database system, so that I can organize and manage insights within my existing workspace while maintaining software independence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes an extract wisdom operation THEN the system SHALL display a "Send to Database" action that replaces the existing "Export to Spreadsheet" option
2. WHEN a user selects "Send to Database" THEN the system SHALL simultaneously save to both Notion database (primary) and CSV file (backup) for software independence
3. WHEN the database operation is successful THEN the system SHALL create a new Notion page with all data columns mapped to appropriate properties AND append the same data to a CSV file
4. WHEN the database integration completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display a success toast notification with links to both the created Notion page and CSV file location

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user setting up the Notion integration, I want to configure my Notion API token and database ID through the extension preferences, so that I can securely connect to my Notion workspace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens extension preferences THEN the system SHALL provide fields for Notion API token and database ID configuration
2. WHEN a user enters a Notion API token THEN the system SHALL store it securely in Raycast preferences
3. WHEN a user attempts to use Notion integration without proper configuration THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages guiding them to configure the required settings
4. IF the Notion API token is invalid THEN the system SHALL display an authentication error with instructions to verify the token

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with existing extraction data, I want the system to automatically map my 20-column extraction results to appropriate Notion database properties, so that all my data is preserved and organized correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending data to Notion THEN the system SHALL map all 20 CSV columns to corresponding Notion database properties
2. WHEN the target Notion database lacks required properties THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which properties need to be created
3. WHEN data types don't match between CSV and Notion properties THEN the system SHALL handle type conversion gracefully or provide informative error messages
4. WHEN large text content exceeds Notion limits THEN the system SHALL truncate content appropriately while preserving key information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer troubleshooting Notion integration issues, I want comprehensive error handling and debug logging, so that I can quickly identify and resolve integration problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any Notion API call fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including API response codes and messages
2. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with retry options
3. WHEN rate limiting occurs THEN the system SHALL handle rate limits gracefully with appropriate backoff strategies
4. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging of all Notion API interactions and data mapping operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user working with multiple Notion databases, I want to be able to specify which database to send results to, so that I can organize different types of extractions in appropriate databases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Notion integration THEN the system SHALL allow users to specify a target database ID
2. WHEN a user has multiple databases THEN the system SHALL validate that the specified database exists and is accessible
3. IF the specified database is not found THEN the system SHALL display an error message with instructions to verify the database ID
4. WHEN the database structure changes THEN the system SHALL provide helpful guidance on updating property mappings
