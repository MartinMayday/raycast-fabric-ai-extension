# Design Document

## Overview

The Custom Pattern Creation Framework provides a systematic approach to developing new Fabric AI patterns using existing patterns as reference templates. This framework focuses on creating four specialized landing page analysis patterns while establishing reusable methodologies for future pattern development. The system analyzes successful existing patterns, extracts common structures and best practices, and provides guided template generation with comprehensive testing and validation tools.

## Pattern Creation Methodology

### Template Generation Process

```typescript
interface PatternTemplate {
  identity: string;
  purpose: string;
  steps: string[];
  outputSections: string[];
  outputInstructions: string[];
  sampleInputs: SampleInput[];
  expectedOutputs: ExpectedOutput[];
}

class PatternTemplateGenerator {
  generateTemplate(patternType: string, existingPatterns: Pattern[]): PatternTemplate {
    const similarPatterns = this.findSimilarPatterns(patternType, existingPatterns);
    const commonStructure = this.extractCommonStructure(similarPatterns);
    const domainSpecifics = this.getDomainSpecifics(patternType);
    
    return this.combineIntoTemplate(commonStructure, domainSpecifics);
  }
  
  private findSimilarPatterns(type: string, patterns: Pattern[]): Pattern[] {
    // Analyze existing patterns for structural similarities
    return patterns.filter(p => this.calculateSimilarity(type, p.type) > 0.7);
  }
  
  private extractCommonStructure(patterns: Pattern[]): CommonStructure {
    // Extract common elements like output sections, instruction patterns
    return {
      identityPatterns: this.extractIdentityPatterns(patterns),
      stepPatterns: this.extractStepPatterns(patterns),
      outputPatterns: this.extractOutputPatterns(patterns)
    };
  }
}
```

### Validation System

```typescript
class PatternValidator {
  validatePattern(pattern: CustomPattern): ValidationResult {
    const results: ValidationResult = {
      syntaxValid: this.validateSyntax(pattern),
      structureValid: this.validateStructure(pattern),
      outputFormatValid: this.validateOutputFormat(pattern),
      sampleTestsPassed: this.runSampleTests(pattern),
      qualityScore: 0
    };
    
    results.qualityScore = this.calculateQualityScore(results);
    return results;
  }
  
  private validateSyntax(pattern: CustomPattern): boolean {
    // Check for required sections, proper markdown formatting
    const requiredSections = ['IDENTITY', 'PURPOSE', 'STEPS', 'OUTPUT'];
    return requiredSections.every(section => 
      pattern.content.includes(`# ${section}`)
    );
  }
  
  private runSampleTests(pattern: CustomPattern): boolean {
    // Test pattern with sample inputs, validate outputs
    return pattern.sampleInputs.every(input => {
      const output = this.executePattern(pattern, input);
      return this.validateOutput(output, pattern.expectedFormat);
    });
  }
}
```

## Integration with Pattern Registry

### Registry Integration

```typescript
class CustomPatternIntegrator {
  async integratePattern(customPattern: CustomPattern): Promise<void> {
    // Validate pattern meets standards
    const validation = await this.validator.validatePattern(customPattern);
    if (!validation.syntaxValid || validation.qualityScore < 70) {
      throw new Error('Pattern does not meet quality standards');
    }
    
    // Generate pattern configuration
    const config: PatternConfig = {
      name: customPattern.name,
      category: this.determineCategory(customPattern),
      description: customPattern.description,
      icon: this.selectIcon(customPattern.category),
      inputTypes: customPattern.supportedInputTypes,
      outputFormat: this.determineOutputFormat(customPattern),
      fabricArgs: ['--pattern', customPattern.name],
      parsing: {
        sections: this.extractOutputSections(customPattern),
        customParser: customPattern.customParser
      },
      export: {
        csvColumns: this.generateCSVColumns(customPattern),
        notionProperties: this.generateNotionProperties(customPattern)
      }
    };
    
    // Add to registry
    await this.patternRegistry.addPattern(config);
    
    // Create command file
    await this.generateCommandFile(customPattern);
    
    // Update package.json
    await this.updatePackageJson(customPattern);
  }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Comprehensive Testing Framework

```typescript
class PatternTestSuite {
  async testCustomPattern(pattern: CustomPattern): Promise<TestResults> {
    const results: TestResults = {
      syntaxTests: await this.runSyntaxTests(pattern),
      structureTests: await this.runStructureTests(pattern),
      outputTests: await this.runOutputTests(pattern),
      integrationTests: await this.runIntegrationTests(pattern),
      performanceTests: await this.runPerformanceTests(pattern)
    };
    
    return results;
  }
  
  private async runOutputTests(pattern: CustomPattern): Promise<OutputTestResults> {
    const results: OutputTestResults = { passed: 0, failed: 0, details: [] };
    
    for (const sampleInput of pattern.sampleInputs) {
      try {
        const output = await this.executePattern(pattern, sampleInput.content);
        const isValid = this.validateOutputStructure(output, pattern.expectedFormat);
        
        if (isValid) {
          results.passed++;
        } else {
          results.failed++;
          results.details.push(`Invalid output for input: ${sampleInput.name}`);
        }
      } catch (error) {
        results.failed++;
        results.details.push(`Execution failed for input: ${sampleInput.name} - ${error.message}`);
      }
    }
    
    return results;
  }
}
```
