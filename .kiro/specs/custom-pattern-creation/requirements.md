# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the creation of custom Fabric AI patterns using existing patterns as reference templates. The system will provide a structured framework for designing, implementing, and testing new patterns, with specific focus on creating four landing page analysis patterns: analyze_wireframe_flow, analyze_copywriting_score, create_storybrand_variant, and create_competitive_audit. The framework will include pattern templates, specification guidelines, sample collections, and validation tools to ensure new patterns meet quality standards and integrate seamlessly with the existing pattern registry.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer creating custom Fabric patterns, I want a structured template system based on existing patterns, so that I can create high-quality patterns that follow established conventions and output formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new pattern THEN the system SHALL provide a template generator that analyzes existing patterns and creates a structured template
2. WHEN using the template THEN it SHALL include sections for IDENTITY, PURPOSE, STEPS, OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS, and INPUT based on successful pattern structures
3. WHEN the template is generated THEN it SHALL include examples from similar existing patterns to guide implementation
4. WHEN a pattern template is created THEN it SHALL be validated against the official_pattern_template for consistency

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer designing landing page analysis patterns, I want detailed specifications and sample collections for each pattern type, so that I can understand the expected inputs, outputs, and analysis criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating analyze_wireframe_flow pattern THEN the system SHALL provide specifications for analyzing user flow, navigation patterns, conversion funnels, and UX design elements
2. WHEN creating analyze_copywriting_score pattern THEN the system SHALL define criteria for messaging effectiveness, clarity, persuasion techniques, and conversion optimization
3. WHEN creating create_storybrand_variant pattern THEN the system SHALL include StoryBrand framework elements: character, problem, guide, plan, call-to-action, success, and failure
4. WHEN creating create_competitive_audit pattern THEN the system SHALL specify SWOT analysis components, competitive positioning, and improvement recommendations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer implementing custom patterns, I want sample input collections and expected output examples, so that I can test and validate pattern functionality before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing a new pattern THEN the system SHALL provide at least 5 sample inputs representing different scenarios and complexity levels
2. WHEN testing pattern outputs THEN the system SHALL include expected output examples that demonstrate proper formatting and content structure
3. WHEN validating patterns THEN sample collections SHALL cover edge cases, minimal content, and comprehensive content scenarios
4. WHEN patterns are tested THEN the system SHALL verify outputs match expected formats and quality standards

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer ensuring pattern quality, I want automated validation and testing tools, so that custom patterns meet the same standards as existing Fabric patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a custom pattern is created THEN the system SHALL validate the pattern syntax and structure against Fabric pattern standards
2. WHEN testing custom patterns THEN the system SHALL run automated tests using sample input collections
3. WHEN patterns fail validation THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and improvement suggestions
4. WHEN patterns pass validation THEN they SHALL be automatically integrated into the pattern registry for use

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining pattern consistency, I want integration with the existing pattern registry system, so that custom patterns work seamlessly with the broader framework.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN custom patterns are created THEN they SHALL be automatically registered in the pattern registry with appropriate metadata
2. WHEN patterns are integrated THEN they SHALL support the same export formats (CSV, Notion) as existing patterns
3. WHEN using custom patterns THEN they SHALL work with pattern chaining and suggestion systems
4. WHEN patterns are deployed THEN they SHALL be available through the same UI and command structure as built-in patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer creating specialized analysis patterns, I want domain-specific guidance and best practices, so that patterns provide meaningful and actionable insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating UX analysis patterns THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on user experience principles, conversion optimization, and usability heuristics
2. WHEN creating copywriting analysis patterns THEN the system SHALL include frameworks for persuasion, clarity, and messaging effectiveness evaluation
3. WHEN creating business analysis patterns THEN the system SHALL incorporate strategic frameworks like StoryBrand, SWOT, and competitive analysis methodologies
4. WHEN patterns analyze content THEN they SHALL provide actionable recommendations and specific improvement suggestions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer scaling pattern creation, I want documentation and knowledge base integration, so that pattern creation knowledge is preserved and shared effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN patterns are created THEN the system SHALL automatically generate documentation including purpose, usage examples, and output formats
2. WHEN patterns are successful THEN their templates and approaches SHALL be added to the knowledge base for future pattern creation
3. WHEN developers create patterns THEN they SHALL have access to a searchable database of pattern creation best practices and examples
4. WHEN patterns are updated THEN documentation SHALL be automatically updated to reflect changes and improvements
