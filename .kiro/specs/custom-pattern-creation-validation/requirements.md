# Custom Pattern Creation Validation Requirements

## Introduction

Before proceeding to any new features (notion-database-integration, notion-watcher-automation, pattern-registry-framework, raycast-extension-monetization), we must validate that the custom-pattern-creation feature actually works in real-world practice. All current documentation shows theoretical completion but lacks practical validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-World Pattern Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the custom patterns actually work when executed through Fabric AI, so that I can confirm the system is production-ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I execute `fabric --pattern analyze_wireframe_flow` with real input THEN the system SHALL produce valid output matching the expected format
2. WHEN I execute `fabric --pattern analyze_copywriting_score` with real input THEN the system SHALL produce valid output with scoring metrics
3. WHEN I execute `fabric --pattern create_storybrand_variant` with real input THEN the system SHALL produce valid StoryBrand framework output
4. WHEN I execute `fabric --pattern create_competitive_audit` with real input THEN the system SHALL produce valid competitive analysis output
5. IF any pattern fails execution THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging information

### Requirement 2: Pattern File Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the pattern files are syntactically correct and properly formatted, so that Fabric AI can parse and execute them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I validate pattern file syntax THEN each pattern SHALL conform to official Fabric AI pattern structure
2. WHEN I check pattern metadata THEN each pattern SHALL have proper IDENTITY, PURPOSE, STEPS, and OUTPUT sections
3. WHEN I verify pattern commands THEN each pattern SHALL be properly registered in the system
4. IF any pattern has syntax errors THEN the validation SHALL identify specific issues and provide fixes

### Requirement 3: Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the patterns integrate properly with the Raycast extension, so that users can access them through the UI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the Raycast extension THEN all 4 custom patterns SHALL appear in the pattern list
2. WHEN I select a custom pattern in Raycast THEN the pattern SHALL execute properly with user input
3. WHEN I use CSV export functionality THEN the custom pattern output SHALL export correctly to CSV format
4. WHEN I test pattern chaining THEN custom patterns SHALL work with existing pattern workflows
5. IF any integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error details and resolution steps

### Requirement 4: Performance and Reliability Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the patterns perform reliably under various conditions, so that users have a consistent experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I test patterns with various input sizes THEN the system SHALL handle small, medium, and large inputs appropriately
2. WHEN I test patterns with edge cases THEN the system SHALL handle empty input, malformed input, and unusual content gracefully
3. WHEN I measure execution time THEN patterns SHALL complete within reasonable time limits (< 30 seconds for typical input)
4. WHEN I test concurrent execution THEN multiple patterns SHALL run simultaneously without conflicts
5. IF performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide performance metrics and optimization recommendations

### Requirement 5: Documentation Accuracy Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the documentation accurately reflects the actual system behavior, so that future development is based on accurate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I compare documentation to actual implementation THEN all documented features SHALL exist and work as described
2. WHEN I follow setup instructions THEN the system SHALL install and configure correctly
3. WHEN I use documented examples THEN they SHALL produce the expected results
4. WHEN I check API documentation THEN all methods and classes SHALL exist with correct signatures
5. IF documentation is inaccurate THEN it SHALL be updated to reflect actual system behavior

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Recovery Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the system handles errors gracefully and provides useful feedback, so that issues can be diagnosed and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pattern execution fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with specific details
2. WHEN invalid input is provided THEN the system SHALL validate input and provide helpful feedback
3. WHEN system dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL detect and report missing components
4. WHEN configuration is incorrect THEN the system SHALL identify configuration issues and suggest fixes
5. IF errors occur THEN the system SHALL log sufficient detail for debugging and provide recovery suggestions

### Requirement 7: Deployment Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the deployment process actually works and produces a functional system, so that the patterns can be used in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the deployment process THEN all pattern files SHALL be correctly placed in the Fabric AI patterns directory
2. WHEN I verify pattern registration THEN all patterns SHALL be available through `fabric --list` command
3. WHEN I test Raycast integration THEN the extension SHALL recognize and execute all custom patterns
4. WHEN I validate export functionality THEN CSV and Notion export SHALL work with real data
5. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities and error diagnostics

### Requirement 8: User Experience Validation

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to verify that the patterns provide valuable, accurate analysis, so that I can trust the results for real work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I analyze a real wireframe THEN the wireframe flow analysis SHALL provide actionable insights
2. WHEN I analyze real copywriting THEN the copywriting score SHALL reflect actual persuasiveness and clarity
3. WHEN I create a StoryBrand variant THEN the output SHALL follow proper SB7 framework principles
4. WHEN I perform competitive audit THEN the analysis SHALL provide meaningful competitive insights
5. IF results are inaccurate or unhelpful THEN the patterns SHALL be refined based on real-world feedback
