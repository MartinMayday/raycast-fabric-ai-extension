# Custom Pattern Creation Validation - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan leverages yesterday's successful Raycast extension deployment to quickly add 4 custom patterns. Since we already have a working foundation with extract-wisdom, this should take minutes not hours - we're just adding new commands using the same proven structure and deployment process.

## Implementation Tasks

- [x] 1. Verify pattern files are ready (already exist in patterns/ directory)
  - âœ… All 4 custom pattern files exist: analyze_wireframe_flow.md, analyze_copywriting_score.md, create_storybrand_variant.md, create_competitive_audit.md
  - Quick syntax check to ensure they follow Fabric AI pattern format
  - Verify patterns work with `fabric --list` and `fabric --pattern <name>` commands
  - Confirm Fabric AI can access and execute these patterns
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 2. Add custom patterns to existing Raycast extension (leveraging yesterday's working foundation)
  - [x] 2.1 Add 4 new pattern commands to existing package.json
    - Copy existing extract-wisdom command structure as template
    - Add commands for: analyze-wireframe-flow, analyze-copywriting-score, create-storybrand-variant, create-competitive-audit
    - Use existing preferences and configuration (fabricInstallPath, maxContentLength, timeoutSeconds, exportPath)
    - Leverage existing CSV export functionality from extract-wisdom
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 7.1_

  - [x] 2.2 Create command files using existing extract-wisdom-ultimate.tsx as template
    - Copy fabricai-extension/src/extract-wisdom-ultimate.tsx to create 4 new command files
    - Update each file to use the specific custom pattern (--pattern analyze_wireframe_flow, etc.)
    - Modify titles, descriptions, and UI text for each pattern
    - Keep existing error handling, CSV export, and debug logging functionality
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 3.2, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [x] 3. Quick build and deploy (should take minutes, not hours)
  - [x] 3.1 Build extension using existing working setup
    - Navigate to fabricai-extension directory
    - Run `npm run build` (same process as yesterday's successful deployment)
    - Verify build completes without errors (should be quick since foundation exists)
    - Check that all 6 commands now appear (2 existing + 4 new custom patterns)
    - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2_

  - [x] 3.2 Deploy to Raycast using existing process
    - Use same deployment method as yesterday's successful extract-wisdom deployment
    - Install updated extension in Raycast
    - Verify all 6 commands appear in Raycast command palette
    - Test that existing extract-wisdom commands still work (regression test)
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 7.3_

- [x] 4. Prepare test scenarios for user validation
  - [x] 4.1 Create test content collection
    - Prepare real landing page content for testing each pattern
    - Include various content sizes (small pages ~1K words, medium ~5K words, large sales funnels ~15K+ words)
    - Gather examples of wireframes, copywriting samples, competitive pages, and StoryBrand content
    - Document expected behavior and output format for each test case
    - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4_

  - [x] 4.2 Create user testing guide
    - Document step-by-step testing procedures for each pattern
    - Create checklist of functionality to validate during testing
