# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the current single-pattern Raycast Fabric AI extension into a scalable framework that can support all 200+ Fabric AI patterns. Based on analysis of the complete pattern library, we have identified patterns spanning diverse categories including analysis (analyze_claims, analyze_paper), creation (create_art_prompt, create_mermaid_visualization), extraction (extract_wisdom, extract_business_ideas), improvement (improve_writing, improve_prompt), and specialized tools (export_data_as_csv, create_quiz). The goal is to reduce development time from 6-8 hours per pattern to 2-5 minutes per pattern (100x improvement) by creating a template-based system with auto-generation capabilities and a flexible data schema that can accommodate the diverse output formats across all pattern categories.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the Fabric AI extension, I want to create a BasePattern component that encapsulates all common functionality, so that I can generate new pattern commands without duplicating code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting common functionality from extract-wisdom-ultimate.tsx THEN the system SHALL create a BasePattern component that handles all shared logic including content processing, API calls, UI rendering, and export functionality
2. WHEN a new pattern is needed THEN the system SHALL only require a pattern configuration object to create a fully functional command
3. WHEN the BasePattern component is used THEN it SHALL maintain all existing functionality including YouTube processing, clipboard integration, CSV export, and Notion integration
4. WHEN multiple patterns use BasePattern THEN they SHALL share the same preferences, error handling, and debug logging systems

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer scaling the extension, I want a Pattern Registry system that defines all available Fabric patterns, so that I can manage pattern configurations centrally and generate commands automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Pattern Registry is created THEN it SHALL contain configuration objects for all 200+ Fabric patterns discoverable via `fabric --list`
2. WHEN a pattern configuration is defined THEN it SHALL include pattern name, description, icon, command arguments, and output parsing rules
3. WHEN the registry is updated THEN new patterns SHALL be automatically available for command generation
4. WHEN patterns have different output formats THEN the registry SHALL support custom parsing configurations for each pattern

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer generating new pattern commands, I want an auto-generation system that creates complete Raycast commands from pattern configurations, so that I can add new patterns in minutes instead of hours.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the pattern discovery process THEN the system SHALL execute `fabric --list` to get all available patterns and update the registry
2. WHEN generating a new pattern command THEN the system SHALL create a complete TypeScript file with proper imports, exports, and Raycast command structure
3. WHEN a pattern is generated THEN it SHALL include proper package.json command entries, icons, and metadata
4. WHEN generating multiple patterns THEN the system SHALL handle batch generation efficiently and avoid conflicts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the extended Fabric AI extension, I want access to all 200+ Fabric patterns through the same intuitive interface, so that I can use any pattern without learning new workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using any generated pattern command THEN the user interface SHALL be consistent with the existing extract_wisdom experience
2. WHEN a pattern has unique output sections THEN the UI SHALL dynamically adapt to display pattern-specific content appropriately
3. WHEN exporting results from any pattern THEN both CSV and Notion export SHALL work with pattern-specific data structures
4. WHEN switching between patterns THEN users SHALL have the same keyboard shortcuts, actions, and preferences available

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the pattern framework, I want comprehensive validation and testing systems, so that I can ensure all generated patterns work correctly and maintain quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pattern is generated THEN the system SHALL validate that the pattern exists in Fabric AI and can be executed
2. WHEN testing generated patterns THEN the system SHALL provide automated testing capabilities for basic functionality
3. WHEN patterns fail validation THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggestions for resolution
4. WHEN deploying pattern updates THEN the system SHALL ensure backward compatibility with existing user preferences and data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer optimizing the development workflow, I want build and deployment automation, so that I can generate, test, and deploy new patterns with minimal manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the build process THEN the system SHALL automatically discover new patterns, generate commands, and update package.json
2. WHEN patterns are added or updated THEN the system SHALL automatically run validation tests and report any issues
3. WHEN deploying the extension THEN all generated patterns SHALL be included with proper metadata and documentation
4. WHEN managing the pattern lifecycle THEN the system SHALL support adding, updating, and deprecating patterns systematically

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user working with different types of content, I want pattern-specific optimizations and preprocessing, so that each pattern can work optimally with its intended content types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pattern is designed for specific content types THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate preprocessing and validation
2. WHEN patterns have different input requirements THEN the system SHALL guide users on proper content formatting
3. WHEN content doesn't match pattern expectations THEN the system SHALL provide helpful suggestions or automatic adjustments
4. WHEN patterns produce different output formats THEN the export systems SHALL adapt to preserve all relevant data

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer implementing the pattern framework, I want a flexible data schema that can accommodate all pattern output formats, so that both CSV and Notion exports work seamlessly across all 200+ patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing pattern outputs THEN the system SHALL identify common data fields across pattern categories (analysis patterns: claims/evidence/ratings, creation patterns: generated content/instructions, extraction patterns: lists/summaries/insights)
2. WHEN exporting pattern results THEN the system SHALL use a universal schema with pattern-specific columns that can accommodate structured data (JSON), lists, ratings, and long-form content
3. WHEN a pattern produces unique output sections THEN the system SHALL dynamically map those sections to appropriate export columns without losing data
4. WHEN patterns have different data types (ratings, lists, structured analysis, creative content) THEN the export system SHALL handle type conversion and formatting appropriately

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user of the pattern framework, I want intelligent pattern suggestions and discovery, so that I can easily find the right pattern for my specific task or content type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs content THEN the system SHALL analyze the content type and suggest appropriate patterns using the suggest_pattern functionality
2. WHEN patterns are categorized by function THEN the system SHALL group them logically (Analysis: 35+ patterns, Creation: 40+ patterns, Extraction: 30+ patterns, Improvement: 15+ patterns, Specialized: 25+ patterns)
3. WHEN users search for patterns THEN the system SHALL provide filtering by category, input type, and output format
4. WHEN a pattern is selected THEN the system SHALL display pattern description, expected input format, and sample output structure
